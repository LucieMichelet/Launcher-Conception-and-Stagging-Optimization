<p> During this project we worked on four different missions, with different difficulties. The aim was to determine the number of stage and mass of the launcher for a specific mission. We also had to optimize them, by using the Lagrange method. </p>

<p> This repository is composed of 2 files "main" and "spacemechanics", make sure to have both of them in the same directory, and a written report that describes ans comment our work.</p>
  
<p>In the report, you will find the description of the mission, all the parameters we used, and the technical specifications of the launcher. The design consists of determining the optimal staging of the launcher to make the mission a success:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of staging;</li>
  <li>The appropriate propellant type;</li>
  <li>The distribution of masses in each stage;</li>
  <li>The azimuth.</li>
</ul>
